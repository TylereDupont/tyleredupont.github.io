<!--For the purpose of debugging, I decided to add a new feature to my website cost calculator which will take an optional salary input and change a <p>.innerhtml element to “recommend” an airline to the user. I predefined 3 separate categories in which the user could be classified (Budget tier, Medium tier, First class Tier.)I encountered my first problem when I wrote an error where the program was not properly grabbing the salary from my html (Html line 81, JS line 38.) To solve this, I first added a console.log method to print the salary variable to the console. When I ran the program my salary was printed as 3 which was very interesting, but it also immediately gave away the error in my program. The issue was that I had copy and pasted “document.getElementById('result')”  and did not change the arguments to ‘salary’, which I was then able to fix easily. I also added a window.alert function on line 48 of the JS to inform the user if they have entered an invalid number for salary (For example, -50.) I also added a few more window.alert methods, and console.log methods within the JS to demonstrate my knowledge of this concept. -->
