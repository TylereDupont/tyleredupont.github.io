			<h3>Goal</h3>
			<p id="italics">Enhance the personal website you've created in the preceding chapters of this book to prevent security issues. To do this, review each form field in your site and identify any additional validation that you could reasonably add. In particular, look for situations where you could use a regular expression to limit the allowable characters in order to exclude characters used in creating JavaScript code.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I created this form which will remove any non-alpha numeric characters from all of the inputted fields, and assign them to the p tags below. The email field will behave as expected.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<p>The web is still a very new place. It can be difficult to remain safe in an unknown place if you don't know what you are up against. </p>
				<!--UL are specified to be center aligned if you want to change that please make a specific class or id for your UL-->
				
				<h2 class="centerhv">What does the web know about you</h2>
				<p>A web application using javascript can gather information about you and your computer. For example, here are some specifications on your device.</p>
				
				<p class="center" id="height">Height</p>
				<p class="center" id="width">Height</p>
				<p class="center" id="appname">Height</p>
				<p class="center" id="appversion">Height</p>
				<p class="center" id="online">Height</p>
				<p class="center" id="platform">Height</p>
				<p class="center" id="longitude">Your longitude: </p>
				<p class="center" id="latitude">Your latitude: </p>
				<p class="center" id="altitude">Your altitude: </p>

				<h4>Keep software up to date</h4>
				<p>It is very important to update your web browser, and operating system whenever possible. These updates contain crucial vulnerability updates, and are your best way to stay safe online.</p>
				
				<h4>Create secure passwords</h4>
				<p>Creating a secure password will not help you if you have installed a keylogger (Software that keeps track of every key you press and sends it to another source) however it will keep you secure from a brute force attack, (A brute force attack is when someone uses a program to randomly guess your password thousands of times.) The best passwords contain letters, caps, numbers, and symbols. (ex. wOOfb@rk!5782) </p>
				
				<h4>Keep your anonymity</h4>
				<p>You need to be extremely careful about what information you give out (to a person, or program.) Scammers online will often impersonate somebody else such as a “virus removal specialist” and will ask for your information and attempt to make you install software on your computer which they can use to gather information about you (Account logins, credit card information, etc.) Remember that anybody can be anybody on the internet, and don’t just give away your information or install programs onto your computer without consulting a professional.</p>
				
				<h4>Keep your network secure</h4>
				<p>When at home or work your password protected router will keep your device, and information safe, however public Wi-Fi connections are often unsecured, leaving your device and information at risk. To stay safe you should install a VPN (Virtual private network.) A VPN will keep your connection secure, and hide your unique Ip address. </p>
				
				<h4>Know the latest scams</h4>
				<p>Be sure to stay up to date on the latest scams going on. A very popular software right now is called Ransomware. If you are tricked into installing Ransomware, an attacker will encrypt all the files on your computer and will not unlock them unless you send money via bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. </p>
				
				<h4>Selective downloading</h4>
				<p>Only download software from sources that you trust such as school, or work. Software from an unknown source could be anything. It could be keeping track of your keypresses and may attempt to hack into your online banking portal, or it may be a bitcoin miner (a piece of software that performs calculations using your pc hardware to earn somebody else money. In short, a bitcoin miner will drastically slow down your pc)</p>
				
				<h4>Hover suspicious links</h4>
				<p>If you hover your mouse over a link, you will be shown the actual destination on the bottom left of your browser. If it looks suspicious or illegitimate in any way, don’t click it.</p>
				
				<h4>Keep your connection secure</h4>
				<p>If a website is secure, http in the address bar will change to https, and you will also see a small padlock icon. If a website is not secure, it may be trying to gather your credit card information for resale on the dark net.</p>
